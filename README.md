ImpView
=======

ImpView is built using Middleman. Run "middleman build" to regenerate the
output folder. You will need to run "bundle install" to install any
dependencies first.

Please submit any patches to hayden@haydenball.me.uk

Usage
-----

In the output folder, open "control.html" in Google Chrome (in theory
all webkit browsers should work, and other browsers with a few minor
changes to vendor specific features in css and js). You will need to
accept the "display.html" pop-up.
