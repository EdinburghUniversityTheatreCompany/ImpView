ImpView
=======

NB: To put the display into fullscreen mode (if it is running as an extension)
press spacebar.

ImpView is built using Middleman. Run "middleman build" to regenerate the
output folder. You will need to run "bundle install" to install any
dependencies first.

Please submit any patches via the issue tracker at
http://redmine.haydenball.me.uk/projects/impview/.

Hint:

    git format-patch master --stdout > mypatch.patch

Usage
-----

In the output folder, open "control.html" in Google Chrome (in theory
all webkit browsers should work, and other browsers with a few minor
changes to vendor specific features in css and js). You will need to
accept the "display.html" pop-up.
